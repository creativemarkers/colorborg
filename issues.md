# slayer issues/bugs

    #things i want to make sure to add before i put this script on hold
        1. fix runner, if run energy is low and running it doesn't verify properly (just switch pixels and maybe color)
        2. home base returner
        3. spits feather count out


    # fighting bugs

        1. clicking on chickens other players are fighting
        2. monster verification needs more work (image to text)


    #pickup bugs
        1.clicking on feathers is dumb without verifcation and it's doing it too much
        use 0,20,0 for feather finding!!! its the stem of the feather and excellent 
        ^this did not work as expected
        but i did clean up the picking up code, so it picks up feathers more consistently know

# things i need to add 
    # slayer script
        #incorporate camera rotation  <- done
        #debugging 
        #gui for slayer

        1. create methods for camera rotation
            - made a method for random camera direction using weights which can be changed on function call
        2. created a new method to find colors randomly
        3. collected data for bug fixes
