# slayer issues/bugs

    # fighting bugs

        1. clicking on chickens other players are fighting
        2. monster verification needs more work (image to text)
        3. trying to click on chickens out of reach 

    # pickup bugs
        1.clicking on feathers is dumb without verifcation and it's doing it too much
        use 0,20,0 for feather finding!!! its the stem of the feather and excellent 
        ^this did not work as expected
        but i did clean up the picking up code, so it picks up feathers more consistently know
        2. find ticket but other entity over it fucking up the verification (adding a right click to try picking up would help)

    # overall issues
        when walking, the current wait times aren't enough, need to be almost doubled, could create a universal function to handle this

# things i need to add 
    # slayer script
        #debugging 
        #gui for slayer
        #return back to base if strays to far, adda  better one
