    first commit, spent most of my time learning git and researching mouse movement to avoid detection
    came to the conclusion it might not be worth and my energy is spent else where. bezier mouse movement
    in specific as they're difficult to implement, will probably come back to it once i've got more experience

    want to actually implement threading
