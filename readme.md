# Ultimate Color Bot 


v 0.0.3 3/8/2024
    forgot to commit my last big update, which i essentially fleshed some more mouse functions, and started working on the invent functions this was about 10 days ago. Today i did a somewhat big refactor luckily i did this early so it
    wasn't too much work, i pretty much but everything into classes. I also began working on the GUI, using tkinter for now. 

v 0.0.2 2/13/2024
    started fleshing out mouseFunctions.py created 4 functions: 
    moveMouse, moveMouseToArea, addVariance, durationVariance
    these still require testing


v 0.0.1 2/12/2024
    first commit, spent most of my time learning git and researching mouse movement to avoid detection
    came to the conclusion it might not be worth and my energy is spent else where. bezier mouse movement
    in specific as they're difficult to implement, will probably come back to it once i've got more experience

    want to actually implement threading
