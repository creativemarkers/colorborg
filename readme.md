# Road Map

these will be in no particular order

0) fully stable fisher
1) Website for clients to log in and download the bot
2) fleshed out database to auth my users and check licenses (sql, apache, azure hosted)
3) fully working f2p fisher, in theory get you to 1-99 fishing on f2p, with full ban evasion
4) include shrimp, trout/salmon, lobster, swordfish
5) pathfinding
6) bank
7) instructions on how to setup the bot (runelite plugins mostly)
8) nice looking gui
9) automatic tesseract install 
10) can take extended break(for ban evasion)
11) f2p miner
12) f2p woodcutter
13) p2p moneymaker, which one i have right now clue


20) real strecth goal: is to incorporate bezier curves for mouse movements
